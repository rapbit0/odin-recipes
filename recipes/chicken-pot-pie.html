        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Versatility is everything. When your family requests a good pot pie in the depths of winter, you want to deliver. When time allows, I happily complicate things. When it doesn’t, this one-pot version is it. It’s earned a spot on the roster because it’s versatile enough to prep ahead (and substitutions offer complexity) but simple to bring together on a weeknight.</p>
        <p>You can always prep your vegetables ahead of time, and the filling can be made up until the point of topping it with the pastry, covered, and refrigerated up to a day ahead. Add the pastry before baking and add roughly 5 minutes to the bake time.</p>
        <p>Whether you prep it ahead or make it all on a weeknight (it’s ready in an hour flat), it’s sure to bring the whole family running to the table.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>4 medium carrots, diced</li>
            <li>4 celery stalks, diced</li>
            <li>1 medium yellow onion, finely diced</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more to taste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more to taste</li>
            <li>1 cup fresh or frozen peas</li>
            <li>1 rotisserie chicken, meat picked and shredded into 1 to 2-inch pieces (about 4 cups)</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1/4 cup (30g) all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons dried dill</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups chicken or vegetable broth</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups plus 1 tablespoon whole milk, divided</li>
            <li>1 frozen puff pastry sheet</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Preheat the oven to 425°F.</strong>
                <p>Position a rack in the center of the oven. Remove a puff pastry sheet from the freezer and set it on the counter to thaw.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Cook the vegetables:</strong>
                <p>Set a 6-quart Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the oil followed by the carrot, celery, onion, salt, and pepper. Sauté until the onions are almost translucent, 7 to 10 minutes. Move the vegetables to a large bowl and add the peas and chicken to the same bowl.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Make the sauce:</strong>
                <p>Return the Dutch oven to medium heat. Add the butter and melt until foamy. Add the flour and stir continuously until the flour is fully incorporated and golden brown, about 1 minute.</p>
                <p>Increase the heat to high. Add the dill, thyme, garlic powder, broth, and 1 1/2 cups milk. Cook, stirring frequently, until bubbling. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer, stirring occasionally, until thickened slightly, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat. Taste and add salt and pepper as needed.</p>
                <p>Add the reserved vegetables and chicken to the sauce and stir to combine.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Add puff pastry and bake:</strong>
                <p>Unfold the thawed puff pastry. With a sharp knife, cut two 2-inch slits in the center of the pastry for steam to escape. If necessary, trim the corners so the pastry fits within your pot. Place the pastry on top of the mixture in the Dutch oven. Use any corner trimmings to patch the gaps around the inside edge of the Dutch oven. Brush the top with milk.</p>
                <p>Cook uncovered until the pastry is puffed and golden all over and the filling is bubbling around the edge, 27 to 37 minutes. Rest for 5 minutes before serving.</p>                
            </li>
        </ol>
